//! A `Turtle` is a Rust handle to a virtual turtle on screen.
//!
//! The `Turtle` starts in the middle of the screen and can be given commands
//! such as `forward(100)` or `left(90)`. While moving across the screen, the
//! turtle draws its path on the canvas. Based on this primitive movements, you
//! can build more complex commands and draw nice patterns.
//!
//! Each `Turtle` has a reference to an underlying `TurtleScreen`, which
//! provides the canvas (i.e. the window) on which the turtle will draw. A
//! `TurtleScreen` can be shared by multiple turtles, in which case the screen
//! will persist as long as at least one turtle remains on it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rurtle::graphic::TurtleScreen;
//! use rurtle::turtle::Turtle;
//! let screen = TurtleScreen::new((640, 480), "Turtle Demo").unwrap();
//! let mut turtle = Turtle::new(screen);
//! for _ in 0..4 {
//!     turtle.forward(100.0);
//!     turtle.right(90.0);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The `Turtle` does not contain much data itself. In addition to the methods
//! defined here, it contains two pointers, one to the underlying `TurtleScreen`
//! and one to a `TurtleData` struct, which contains the actual attributes (such
//! as position, color, ...).
//!
//! The `TurtleScreen` in turn also contains a reference to the same
//! `TurtleData` struct, which it uses to update the image.
//!
//! ```text
//! Turtle
//!        `-- methods update data in   --v
//!                                       TurtleData
//!        ,-- uses the data to draw    --^
//! TurtleScreen
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a `Turtle` via the `Turtle::new` or `Turtle::procreate` methods
//! automatically registers the turtle with the screen. Dropping a `Turtle` will
//! unregister the instance.
//!
//! # Multiple `Turtle`s *or* `TurtleScreen` sharing
//!
//! It is possible to have multiple turtles drawing on the same canvas. To
//! achieve that, you have to create a "root" turtle first with `Turtle::new`
//! and then *clone* that turtle with `Turtle::procreate`. Note that the name
//! `clone` has been avoided to prevent confusion with the `Clone` trait.
//!
//! After procreation, the root turtle is no different than the other turtles.
//! Turtles can safely be dropped without affecting the other turtles. Each
//! drawing action or attribute setting affects the current turtle only
//! (except for the background color), and each turtle will be drawn separately
//! on screen. Dropping a turtle will **NOT** remove its drawings.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rurtle::graphic::TurtleScreen;
//! use rurtle::turtle::Turtle;
//! let screen = TurtleScreen::new((640, 480), "Multi Turtle").unwrap();
//! let mut turtle = Turtle::new(screen);
//! let mut turtles: Vec<Turtle> = Vec::new();
//! for num in 0..4 {
//!     let mut child = turtle.procreate();
//!     child.right(num as f32 * 90.0);
//!     child.forward(100.0);
//!     turtles.push(child); // avoid dropping it
//! }
//! ```
